# Find Your Meals üçï

This is a meal app to store and search meals. I have used an API -  [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)  for fetching different Meals.

I have used simple HTML/CSS with Bootstrap and Vanilla JavaScript.



## Installation


Now need to install anything download my project or clone it and you can use Live Server if you want.
## Features

‚óè Home Page

 - Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
 - Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to ‚ÄúMy favourite meals‚Äù (a list).
 - On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)

‚óè Meal Detail Page

 - Should show information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

‚óè My favourite meals Page
 - Display a list of all the favourite meals.
 - Make this list persistent (should have the same number of meals before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
 - Remove from favourites button: Each meal should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that meal from the list.
